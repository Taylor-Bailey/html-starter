                        In 2049, replicants (bioengineered humans) are servants and slaves in society. K, a replicant, works for the 
                        LAPD as a "Blade Runner"â€”an officer who hunts down and "retires" (kills) rogue replicants. K visits a protein farm and retires the rogue 
                        replicant Sapper Morton. He finds a box buried under a dead tree. At the morgue K finds out they are the remains of a female replicant who 
                        died during an emergency caesarean section.  They conclude it is possible that replicants can reproduce.  At her office, Lieutenant Joshi 
                        (K's superior) is fearful this new knowledge could lead to a war between humans and replicants.  She orders K find and retire the replicant 
                        child to prevent the truth from coming out.

                        K visits the Wallace Corporation headquarters, where the deceased female is identified from DNA archives as Rachael, 
                        an experimental replicant designed by Dr. Tyrell. K learns of Rachael's romantic ties with former blade runner Rick
                        Deckard. The CEO, Niander Wallace, wants to discover the secret to replicant reproduction to expand interstellar 
                        colonization, and sends his replicant enforcer Luv to steal Rachael's remains from LAPD headquarters and follow K to 
                        Rachael's child
