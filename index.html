                        In 2049, replicants (bioengineered humans) are servants and slaves in society. K, a replicant, works for the 
                        LAPD as a "Blade Runner"—an officer who hunts down and "retires" (kills) rogue replicants. K visits a protein farm and retires the rogue 
                        replicant Sapper Morton. He finds a box buried under a dead tree. At the morgue K finds out they are the remains of a female replicant who 
                        died during an emergency caesarean section.  They conclude it is possible that replicants can reproduce.  At her office, Lieutenant Joshi 
                        (K's superior) is fearful this new knowledge could lead to a war between humans and replicants.  She orders K find and retire the replicant 
                        child to prevent the truth from coming out.

                        K visits the Wallace Corporation headquarters, where the deceased female is identified from DNA archives as Rachael, 
                        an experimental replicant designed by Dr. Tyrell. K learns of Rachael's romantic ties with former blade runner Rick
                        Deckard. The CEO, Niander Wallace, wants to discover the secret to replicant reproduction to expand interstellar 
                        colonization, and sends his replicant enforcer Luv to steal Rachael's remains from LAPD headquarters and follow K to 
                        Rachael's child

                            <p>Speech is the vocalized form of communication used by humans, which is based upon the syntactic combination 
                                of items drawn from the lexicon. Each spoken word is created out of the phonetic combination of a limited set 
                                of vowel and consonant speech sound units (phonemes). These vocabularies, the syntax that structures them, and 
                                their sets of speech sound units differ, creating many thousands of different, and mutually unintelligible, 
                                human languages. The vocal abilities that enable humans to produce speech also enable them to sing.

                            <p>Transference (German: Übertragung) is a theoretical phenomenon characterized by unconscious redirection of the 
                               feelings a person has about a second person to feelings the first person has about a third person. It usually
                               concerns feelings from an important second-person relationship from childhood, and is sometimes considered
                               inappropriate.  Transference was first described by psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, who considered it an important 
                               part of treatment in psychoanalysis.
