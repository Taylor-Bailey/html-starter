                <h1>Thx For the MeMeRs</h1>
                <section>In 2049, replicants (bioengineered humans) are servants and slaves in society. K, a replicant, works for the 
LAPD as a "Blade Runner"â€”an officer who hunts down and "retires" (kills) rogue replicants. K visits a protein farm and retires the rogue 
replicant Sapper Morton. He finds a box buried under a dead tree. At the morgue K finds out they are the remains of a female replicant who 
died during an emergency caesarean section.  They conclude it is possible that replicants can reproduce.  At her office, Lieutenant Joshi 
(K's superior) is fearful this new knowledge could lead to a war between humans and replicants.  She orders K find and retire the replicant 
child to prevent the truth from coming out.
